Note: The above code is calibrated for an Arduino UNO. Output is currently set to print time (ms) and wind speed (mph)
separated by a comma. The current output format is used for creating a .csv file for data analysis in excel or other
software, but the lines to print the units can be uncommented for more user friendly serial monitor use.
